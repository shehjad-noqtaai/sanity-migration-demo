# aem-to-sanity-content

AEM → Sanity content migration as five flat scripts. Each step is inspectable on disk, so you can stop between phases and re-run just one.

```
aem-extract    AEM  → output/cache/aem/content/**/*.json          + output/cache/extract-report.json
aem-tags       AEM  → output/cache/categories/*.json + manifest.json + output/cache/tags-report.json   (optional)
aem-transform  cache/aem/content + categories manifest → output/cache/clean/**/*.json + output/cache/transform-report.json
aem-assets     DAM  → output/cache/assets/* + Sanity                + output/cache/assets/manifest.json           (resumable)
aem-import     clean + categories → Sanity (dry-run by default)
```

`aem-tags` is optional — skip it for migrations that don't use AEM taxonomy. When present, it produces Sanity `category` docs (parent-child taxonomy) that `aem-transform` resolves authored `cq:tags` strings against and that `aem-import` publishes ahead of pages.

## Configure

Env vars (can live in `.env`):

## Roots files

`aem-content-roots` — pages to migrate, one per line:

```
@base /content/site/us/en
home
about-us
/content/other-site/top           # absolute path also fine
```

`aem-tag-roots` — AEM tag namespaces to migrate, one per line. Same format. Only namespaces (or subtrees) listed here are walked — there's no canonical "always skip" set in AEM, so sample-content namespaces like `wknd` are simply absent from this file.

```
@base /content/cq:tags
promotion
page-type
/content/cq:tags/wknd
```

## Run

```sh
pnpm aem-extract                                         # fetches everything in roots file
pnpm aem-tags                                            # walks /content/cq:tags/<each listed root>
pnpm aem-transform --registry ./content-type-registry.json
pnpm aem-assets                                          # dry run: downloads only
MIGRATION_DRY_RUN=false pnpm aem-assets                  # uploads to Sanity, rewrites clean docs
pnpm aem-import                                          # dry run
MIGRATION_DRY_RUN=false pnpm aem-import                  # commit docs (categories first, then pages)
```

`--overwrite` on `aem-extract` re-fetches roots that already exist on disk. `--overwrite` on `aem-tags` re-emits category doc files (the manifest is always rewritten). `--include <resourceTypes>` on `aem-transform` restricts the walk to a comma-separated allow-list. `aem-assets` processes one file at a time (sequential, low memory) and is resumable via `manifest.json`; flags:

- `--upload-only` — skip phase 1 (download from AEM); assumes local cache is populated.
- `--link-only` (or `MIGRATION_LINK_ONLY=true`) — skip phases 1 + 2 entirely. Phase 0's ML lookup finds assets already in the Media Library and links them into the dataset. Useful for re-runs, for iterating on link/rewrite logic without re-hitting AEM, or when assets were pushed out-of-band. Mutually exclusive with `--upload-only`. See § *aem-assets — Media Library flow* below for the caveat about the `aemSource` aspect.
- When `AEM_FIXTURES_DIR` is set, phase 1 copies DAM binaries from `{AEM_FIXTURES_DIR}/assets/` (offline demo tenant). See § *Fixture assets mode*.
- `--placeholders` (or `MIGRATION_ASSETS_PLACEHOLDERS=true`) — legacy: skip AEM download; copy SVG files from `./placeholders/` into the local cache (hashed to 12 slots). Mutually exclusive with `--link-only`, `--upload-only`, and `AEM_FIXTURES_DIR`. See § *`--placeholders` mode*.
- `--no-rewrite` — skip the in-place rewrite of `clean/*.json`.

`aem-import` flags:

- `--discard-drafts` (or `MIGRATION_DISCARD_DRAFTS=true`) — delete `drafts.{id}` alongside each published `createOrReplace`. Without this flag a stale draft from a prior run keeps shadowing freshly-imported content in the Studio. Opt-in; destroys authored in-progress edits.

## Type-aware coercion (transform)

AEM's JCR is schemaless on dialog inputs — every authored value arrives in `.infinity.json` as a JSON string, no matter what the dialog widget was. `aem-transform` reads each mapped block's `fields: [{name, type}]` from `content-type-registry.json` and coerces ingested string values into the Sanity-expected scalar:

- **`array-of-blocks`** (richtext) — converted to Portable Text via `@portabletext/block-tools` (parsed through `jsdom`). Decorators (`strong`, `em`, `underline`, `strike-through`, `code`), styles (`normal`, `h1`–`h4`, `blockquote`), lists (`bullet`, `number`), and `link` annotations are preserved. Keys are derived from a SHA1 of `{jcrPath}::{field}:{counter}` so re-runs produce byte-identical clean docs.
- **`number`** — `Number(v)`; kept as-is on `NaN`.
- **`boolean`** — `"true"` / `"false"` literal strings only; kept as-is otherwise so unrecognized values surface in Studio validation rather than being silently remapped.
- **`array-of-reference`** (AEM tagfield) — string array of tag ids (`promotion:payout/recurring-device-credits`) becomes `[{_type:"reference", _key:..., _ref:"category-..."}]` by lookup in `output/cache/categories/manifest.json` (produced by `aem-tags`). Follows `cq:movedTo` aliases. Page-level `cq:tags` on `jcr:content` are lifted onto the page doc's `tags` field via the same resolver. Tag ids not in the manifest get dropped and surfaced in `transform-report.json → unresolvedTagRefs`.

Coercion walks the registry tree recursively — nested `array-of-object` items (e.g. `variableColumn.columnContents[]` rows) get the same treatment as top-level fields via the `itemFields` entries. AEM stores multifield rows in two shapes: canonical ordered (`item0`/`item1`/…) and named-key (`colors: {weddingDresses: {...}, ...}`). Both are materialized into proper arrays — the ordered form by `deepCoerceAemMultifieldMapsToArrays` during `transformInline`, the named-key form by `coerceFieldTypes` when the registry declares the field as `array-of-object` but the value is a plain object. `Object.values` preserves authored order.

Legacy `fields: string[]` registry entries skip every coercion step (pass-through); regenerate the registry via `migrate:schema` to opt in.

## Container components

AEM "container" components (cq:isContainer=true) carry two shapes in one JCR node: authored dialog fields *plus* drop-zone children that are themselves full component instances (e.g. the keys on an `expander` include both `theme` / `singleExpansion` dialog values AND `item_1657754806454`-style child `box` components). Declare those resource types in `aem-component-containers.json` (override with `AEM_COMPONENT_CONTAINERS_FILE`):

```json
{
  "aem-integration/components/expander":     { "childrenField": "items" },
  "aem-integration/components/box":          { "childrenField": "items" },
  "aem-integration/components/column-layout":{ "childrenField": "items" },
  "aem-integration/components/container":    { "childrenField": "items" }
}
```

Transform then does the right thing: dialog fields go through the normal inline + coercion path, while direct child keys with `sling:resourceType` are recursively emitted as pageBuilder blocks under `childrenField`. Nesting works — expander > box > content roundtrips. On the schema side, `migrate:schema` appends a matching `type: "pageBuilder"` field so the Studio palette inside the container matches the top-level page builder (any block is droppable).

## AEM authoring hints (`cq:panelTitle` and friends)

Some AEM authoring metadata lives **outside** the dialog payload — the most common case is the panel heading on accordion / expander panels, which AEM writes as `cq:panelTitle` on each child node rather than as a dialog field. The transform's normal property iterator drops anything with a colon, so the value would be lost without an explicit lift step.

Per-project opt-ins are declared in `aem-component-hints.json` (override with `AEM_COMPONENT_HINTS_FILE`):

```json
{
  "aem-integration/components/box":     ["cq:panelTitle"],
  "aem-integration/components/content": ["cq:panelTitle"]
}
```

The rename vocabulary (which AEM key becomes which Sanity field) is global in `packages/aem-to-sanity-core/src/aem/authoring-hints.ts`:

| AEM key | Sanity field |
| --- | --- |
| `cq:panelTitle` | `panelTitle` |

Two layers, symmetric across stages:

- **Transform** consults the opt-in config keyed by the current node's `sling:resourceType`. If the node is opted in and the property is in its allowlist, the value is renamed via `AEM_AUTHORING_HINTS` and emitted under the Sanity field name. Otherwise colon-bearing keys drop as before. The drift report skips opted-in keys so they don't surface as "unknown props".
- **Schema** (`migrate:schema`) declares a `readOnly` `string` field per opted-in hint on the matching component schema. Read-only because authors don't edit it from the Studio dialog — it's runtime metadata preserved from AEM. Components not listed in this file get no extra fields.

To support a new hint: add the AEM-key → Sanity-field row to `AEM_AUTHORING_HINTS`, then add the AEM key to the relevant component's array in `aem-component-hints.json`. Re-run `pnpm migrate:schema` and `pnpm transform`.

Missing file → no hint behavior on any component. Malformed JSON or invalid entries are a hard error.

## Page-shell components and per-template documents (`aem-page-components.json`)

AEM stores page-level dialog values on the page's `jcr:content` node, and a sibling `cq:template` identifies which template the page was built from. Declare the page-shell `sling:resourceType` and the `cq:template` paths it's authored under in `aem-page-components.json` (override with `AEM_PAGE_COMPONENTS_FILE`):

```json
{
  "uxp/components/structure/page": {
    "templates": [
      "/conf/uxp/settings/wcm/templates/plan-details",
      "/conf/uxp/settings/wcm/templates/news-article"
    ]
  }
}
```

Or, instead of listing every template by hand, let the schema pass discover them from extracted content:

```json
{
  "uxp/components/structure/page": {
    "discover": true
  }
}
```

With `discover: true`, `migrate:schema` walks `output/cache/aem/content/` (populated by `aem-extract`) to enumerate every `cq:template` value on matching `jcr:content` nodes — so the doc-type list grows automatically as new templates appear in your AEM content. Explicit `templates` and `discover: true` can coexist (discovered values append to the explicit list, deduplicated).

`migrate:schema` emits one Sanity document type per (resourceType, template) pair (`planDetailsPage`, `newsArticlePage`, …) and writes an `output/cache/page-templates.json` manifest. `aem-transform` reads that manifest and, for each raw page whose `jcr:content` matches a declared pair, emits a document with:

- `_type` set to the per-template doc type (e.g. `"planDetailsPage"`).
- `title` from `jcr:content/jcr:title` (existing rule; unchanged).
- `pageProperties` — every authored value on `jcr:content` lifted via the same camelCase rule used for ordinary fields, then coerced against the page-shell's `cq:dialog` types (`"true"` → `true`, HTML → Portable Text, etc.). AEM bookkeeping (replication agents, versioning, ContextHub paths) is dropped via an explicit `JCR_CONTENT_BOOKKEEPING_KEYS` denylist so dialog drift surfaces but noise doesn't.
- `featuredImage` lifted from `jcr:content/cq:featuredimage`. The DAM path is moved to `fileReferenceAemPath` so `aem-assets` rewrites it to a real Sanity asset ref the same way it does for fileupload widgets.
- `cqTemplate` — the raw template path, retained for traceability.
- `pageBuilder` walked from `jcr:content/root` (unchanged).

Pages with a declared page-shell `sling:resourceType` but an undeclared `cq:template` fall back to the generic `_type: "page"` document and surface in the transform report under `unknownPageTemplates`. Add the missing template to `aem-page-components.json`, re-run `migrate:schema`, then re-run `transform` + `import` to upgrade them.

Missing / empty file → every page uses the generic `page` doc (today's behavior). Fully backwards compatible — existing tenants need no changes.

## Named-slot components (auto-detected)

A different AEM pattern shows up on components like `media-paragraph`: a single nested child under a **fixed** JCR key (e.g. `content`) whose value is itself a full component with its own `sling:resourceType`. Not a dialog field, not a drop-zone container — just a named slot.

- **Transform** always emits these as single nested blocks under the slot key (`mediaParagraph.content = {_type: 'content', text: [{_type:'block', ...}], ...}`). Detection is structural: any direct child with `sling:resourceType` that isn't already claimed by container logic is a slot. Works on the first run with no config.
- **Schema** catches up on the next `migrate:schema`: that pass scans `output/cache/aem/content/` (extracted content) and appends a typed `defineField({ name: slotKey, type: childTypeName })` to the parent schema. Until then the Studio shows a yellow "Unknown fields found" warning on the nested data but the data itself is preserved.

There's no config for named slots — the shape is inferred from content. Container parents (listed in `aem-component-containers.json`) skip slot synthesis so their drop-zone children stay on the container-items path.

## Timing

Every CLI appends an `Elapsed:` line to its summary. `aem-assets` also reports per-phase durations (`phase 0 (ML dedup)` / `phase 1 (download)` / `phase 2 (upload)` / `phase 3 (link)` / `phase 4 (rewrite)`), which lets you see at a glance whether a slow run is bottlenecked on AEM fetches, ML uploads, or the dataset link API.

## Parallelism in aem-assets

Phases 0, 1, 2, 3 run with a work-stealing pool sized by `ASSET_CONCURRENCY` (default `4`). Phase 0's ML dedup pre-pass resolves every DAM path that already lives in the Media Library, so the downstream phases only touch each DAM path with a single worker — the shared `manifest` is never contended at the same key, and no locks are needed. The manifest file is persisted via synchronous `writeFileSync` + `JSON.stringify`, both atomic relative to the single-threaded event loop. If that ever moves to async `writeFile`, a serial lock becomes mandatory. Output is logged in completion order so progress reflects actual throughput.

## Reports

- `output/cache/extract-report.json` — per-root outcome; HTTP 300/404/auth/too-large failures grouped by category.
- `output/cache/extract-404.log` — one `<jcrPath>\t<fullUrl>` per 404 (only written when 404s occur).
- `output/cache/transform-report.json` — unknown `sling:resourceType`s (with hit counts and example paths), unknown properties per mapped component, transform bails (max-depth or cycle). `aem-transform` also echoes unmapped types to the console at the end of the run as a paste-ready `/apps/...` list (the page root and `responsivegrid` wrapper are hidden — they're always passthroughs, never missing schemas). Add the listed paths to `aem-component-paths`, then re-run `migrate:schema` → `transform` → `import` so the new component's content stops being dropped.
- `output/cache/assets-report.json` — asset download/upload/link counts, failures.
- `output/cache/assets/manifest.json` — per-asset state (damPath → cachedFile → mediaLibraryAssetId → linkedAssetInstanceId → linkedRef + sanityRef). Drives resumability for all four phases: download, upload to Media Library, GDR link to dataset, doc rewrite.

## aem-assets — Media Library flow (@shehjadkhan 2026-04-22)

`aem-assets` runs five phases. Dry-run default stops after phase 1 (local download).

0. **Dedup against the Media Library + manifest staleness check** — GROQ on `aspects.aemSource.damPath`. A hit populates the manifest with both ids so phases 1+2 skip entirely for that asset. When the lookup misses but the manifest claims an `mediaLibraryAssetId`, phase 0 verifies the doc still exists in the ML by id; if it's been deleted (e.g. ML wipe), the stale linkage is cleared so phases 2-3 re-upload + re-link for real. Transport errors are treated conservatively — manifest state is preserved and the next healthy-network run re-verifies. Requires the `aemSource` aspect to be deployed once per ML. Skipped on dry-run by default; `--link-only` forces it to run (safe, read-only).
1. **Download** AEM DAM binary → local cache in `output/cache/assets/`.
2. **Upload to Media Library** — `POST https://api.sanity.io/v{apiVersion}/media-libraries/{mlId}/upload`. Response `{asset: {_id}, assetInstance: {_id}}` captures the parent asset id and the versioned instance id (both needed for step 3). Uses `SANITY_TOKEN`. A project robot token historically worked here, but newer Media Library API versions reject project-scoped sessions with `401 SIO-401-ANF "Session not found"` — when that happens, swap in a **personal auth token** (see `docs/running-the-migration.md` § 4c-bis for how to mint one).
3. **Link to dataset** — `POST https://{projectId}.api.sanity.io/v{apiVersion}/assets/media-library-link/{dataset}` with body `{mediaLibraryId, assetInstanceId, assetId}`. Response `{document: {_id, media: {_ref}, ...}}` — `document._id` is the dataset-local asset ref that goes into docs. **Requires a personal auth token** (`SANITY_ML_LINK_TOKEN`) because the endpoint rejects project robot tokens with `401 Invalid non-global session`. See `docs/running-the-migration.md` § 4c-bis.
4. **Rewrite clean docs** in place — every `/content/dam/...` string becomes `{_type:'image'|'file', asset:{_ref:'<linked-ref>'}}`. Pattern A (Studio-compatible), matches existing doc shape.

### `--link-only` mode

Runs phase 0, skips phases 1 + 2, runs phases 3 + 4. Use when assets are already in the ML (from an earlier run or pushed out-of-band). Any DAM path that phase 0 can't find in the ML is reported up front and ends up in the phase-4 `unresolved` summary. Phase 0's lookup only finds assets that this pipeline previously stamped — assets uploaded through the Studio UI without the `aemSource` aspect won't resolve by DAM path.

### Fixture assets mode

When `AEM_FIXTURES_DIR` is set, phase 1 copies committed DAM binaries from `{AEM_FIXTURES_DIR}/assets/` into the local asset cache (same flatten naming as the asset cache: `/content/dam/foo/bar.jpg` → `foo--bar.jpg`). Phases 2–4 run unchanged. Used by the offline [`tenants/demo/`](../../tenants/demo/) tenant. Mutually exclusive with `--placeholders`.

### `--placeholders` mode (legacy)

Skips AEM download (phase 1). Copies SVG files from `./placeholders/` into the local asset cache — each DAM path hashes to one of 12 slots (`placeholder-slot-00.svg` … `placeholder-slot-11.svg`). Prefer fixture images for the demo tenant. Mutually exclusive with `--link-only`, `--upload-only`, and `AEM_FIXTURES_DIR`.

Manifest entry shape (`output/cache/assets/manifest.json`):

```ts
{
  damPath: "/content/dam/dbi/m1.png",
  cachedFile: "/path/to/output/cache/assets/dbi--m1.png",
  mimeType: "image/png", fileSize: 4049,
  mediaLibraryAssetId: "3CjO...",                // asset._id in ML
  linkedAssetInstanceId: "image-<sha1>-WxH-png", // assetInstance._id in ML
  linkedRef: "image-<sha1>-WxH-png",             // dataset-local ref — used as asset._ref
  mediaRef: "media-library:mlTnBi...:3CjO...",    // GDR reference
  sanityRef: {_type:"image", asset:{_type:"reference", _ref:"image-<sha1>-WxH-png"}},
  status: "linked",
  downloadedAt, uploadedAt, linkedAt
}
```

Re-runs are idempotent: a populated `linkedRef` skips upload + link; a populated `cachedFile` skips download.
