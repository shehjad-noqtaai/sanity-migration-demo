/**
 * Example Studio that consumes the schemas emitted by `aem-to-sanity-schema`.
 *
 * `sanitizeSchemaTypes` handles the two cases where an AEM → Sanity mapping
 * produces on-disk schemas that Sanity Studio refuses to load as-is:
 *   - type names colliding with Sanity built-ins (e.g. `image`) get an `aem`
 *     prefix;
 *   - object types with zero fields get a hidden placeholder field.
 * The emitted files stay faithful to AEM's shape; this transform is applied
 * at import time.
