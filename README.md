# aem-to-sanity

**An end-to-end toolkit for migrating Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) content into Sanity** — reads AEM component dialogs and authored pages over HTTP, emits a real Sanity Studio schema, transforms content into Sanity-shaped documents (with Portable Text, image refs, taxonomy references), and writes everything via `@sanity/client`. Deterministic, resumable, dry-run by default.

> 🎞️ **Start here:** open [`docs/aem-to-sanity-standalone.html`](docs/aem-to-sanity-standalone.html) in a browser. Seven slides that walk through the pipeline, asset flow, operating modes, commands, run output, implementation, and architecture. Best for reviewers, stakeholders, and new operators getting oriented in 10 minutes.

## What this is

AEM exposes two things over HTTP as JSON:

- `{host}{componentPath}/_cq_dialog.infinity.json` — the Granite UI form that defines a component's fields.
- `{host}{contentPath}.infinity.json` — the authored content tree under `/content/...`, truncated at depth ~5.

Sanity expects TypeScript `defineType` / `defineField` schemas and JSON documents with `_type`, `_id`, `_key`, references, Portable Text, and asset refs.

**This repo is the bridge.** Two stages plus a content pipeline:

```

The frontend that renders migrated content lives in a separate repo, [`aem-to-sanity-demo-web`](https://github.com/demo-repositories/aem-to-sanity-demo-web). This repo is the **migration toolkit**; that one is the **demo storefront** that consumes its output.

Every artifact has a content-derived identity (JCR path → `_id`, JCR UUID → `_key`, DAM path → manifest key), so **re-runs converge instead of duplicating**.

---

## How it works (5-minute version)

| Stage | CLI | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Schemas** | `migrate:schema` | Fetches each `_cq_dialog.infinity.json`, walks the Granite UI tree (supertype chain included), auto-discovers named-slot children and container drop-zones, emits one Sanity object type per AEM component plus a `pageBuilder` array and per-template page document types. |
| **Types** | `typegen` | Generates `sanity.types.ts` from the emitted schemas via `@sanity/schema` (in-process — no network call, no Studio required). |
| **Extract** | `aem-extract` | Walks `{root}.infinity.json` for each content root, transparently following depth-5 truncation markers. Writes `output/cache/raw/*.json`. |
| **Tags** | `aem-tags` | Walks `/content/cq:tags/...` and emits one Sanity `category` doc per `cq:Tag` (parent-child taxonomy). Optional; skip for migrations without AEM tags. |
| **Transform** | `aem-transform` | Maps `sling:resourceType` → Sanity types via the generated registry. Coerces AEM's JSON strings into proper types: HTML → Portable Text, `"true"` → `boolean`, `"10"` → `number`, tag refs → resolved Sanity references, recursively through nested multifields. Writes `output/cache/clean/*.json`. |
| **Assets** | `aem-assets` | Five phases — ML dedup, AEM download, Media Library upload, dataset link, in-place rewrite of clean docs. Resumable via `output/cache/assets/manifest.json`. Work-stealing pool sized by `ASSET_CONCURRENCY`. |
| **Import** | `aem-import` | Commits docs via `@sanity/client` `transaction().createOrReplace().commit()`. Categories first, pages second. Optional `--discard-drafts` for re-imports. |

**Dry-run by default.** Real writes are an explicit opt-in via `MIGRATION_DRY_RUN=false`.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 0. Install + build (pnpm ≥ 9, Node ≥ 20)
pnpm install
pnpm build

# 1. Scaffold a tenant folder from the committed template
pnpm migrate:init acme
pnpm install

# 2. Fill in credentials
$EDITOR tenants/acme/.env       # AEM source + Sanity destination
$EDITOR apps/studio/.env              # Sanity Studio project id

# 3. Verify the tenant is wired up correctly
pnpm migrate:doctor acme

# 4. Dry-run the whole pipeline
pnpm --filter tenant-acme migrate

# 5. Real write to Sanity
MIGRATION_DRY_RUN=false pnpm --filter tenant-acme migrate

# 6. Open the Studio to verify
pnpm --filter studio dev              # http://localhost:3333
```

Need `AEM_*` and `SANITY_*` credentials before step 4 — see [`docs/running-the-migration.md` § 1a](docs/running-the-migration.md) for the full env table, including the **AEMaaCS Service Credentials** flow (recommended over basic auth / dev tokens).

### Tenant folders

Every migration runs from `tenants/<your-tenant>/`. Only `tenants/template/` (the template) is committed; operator copies are gitignored so credentials, customer-specific component lists, and run output stay local. Inside a tenant folder:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `.env` | AEM creds + Sanity destination |
| `aem-component-paths` | JCR paths of components to migrate, one per line |
| `aem-content-roots` | Content paths to walk during extract, with `@base` sections |
| `aem-tag-roots` | AEM tag namespaces to migrate (optional) |
| `aem-component-exceptions` | `sling:resourceType` values to skip |
| `aem-component-containers.json` | Components with drop-zone children (`cq:isContainer=true`) |
| `aem-component-hints.json` | Components opting into AEM authoring hints (`cq:panelTitle` etc.) |
| `aem-page-components.json` | Page-shell components + their `cq:template` paths |
| `output/cache/…` | Per-stage artifacts — gitignored caches, regenerable |

---

## Packages

Three packages designed so external teams can consume only what they need.

### `aem-to-sanity-core`
Shared primitives — AEM client (basic auth / bearer / Service Credentials via Adobe IMS), config loader, logger, depth-truncation handler. No business logic. → [README](packages/aem-to-sanity-core/README.md)

### `aem-to-sanity-schema`
Dialog walker → mapper → emitter → registry → pageBuilder synthesizer → TypeGen. Resolves `sling:resourceSuperType` chains automatically. Emits deterministic prettier-formatted output. → [README](packages/aem-to-sanity-schema/README.md)

### `aem-to-sanity-content`
Five CLIs (`aem-extract`, `aem-tags`, `aem-transform`, `aem-assets`, `aem-import`) chained through on-disk artifacts. Type-aware coercion via the registry. Resumable per-stage. → [README](packages/aem-to-sanity-content/README.md)

---

## Apps

| App | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`apps/studio`](apps/studio/) | Sanity Studio that loads the migrated schemas from `apps/studio/schemas/generated/`. Used for visual verification and content editing post-migration. |
| **Frontend (separate repo)** | Demo storefronts that consume migrated content live in [`aem-to-sanity-demo-web`](https://github.com/demo-repositories/aem-to-sanity-demo-web) — a Vite + React 19 preview and a Hydrogen (Shopify + Remix) skeleton. Out of scope here, but part of the broader migration story. |

## Common workflows

```bash
# Re-run a single stage without redoing the others
pnpm --filter tenant-<tenant> extract
pnpm --filter tenant-<tenant> transform

# Re-link assets without re-uploading (e.g. ML already has the binaries)
pnpm --filter tenant-<tenant> assets -- --link-only

# Discard shadowing drafts in the Studio after re-import
pnpm --filter tenant-<tenant> import -- --discard-drafts

# Probe a single AEM dialog (resolve the supertype chain without running the migrator)
pnpm exec tsx scripts/aem-probe.ts /apps/<site>/components/proxy/foo

# Validate emitted schemas
pnpm --filter studio exec sanity schema validate

# Audit every tenant under tenants/ for template drift
pnpm migrate:doctor --all
```

---

## Design principles

- **Deterministic output.** Same input → byte-identical files. `git diff` shows only real changes.
- **Dry-run by default.** Anything that writes to Sanity is opt-in via `MIGRATION_DRY_RUN=false`.
- **Upserts, not duplicates.** Content-derived `_id`s mean re-runs converge.
- **Unknown shapes are findings, not failures.** The pipeline keeps going; the audit reports tell you what to fix next.
- **Soft on content drift, loud on misconfig.** Malformed config / missing env / schema validation errors fail fast. Unmapped resource types become action items in the report.
- **Separation of concerns.** Core owns fetching + auth + config; schema and content packages own their transforms. External projects depend on only what they need.

## Stack

**pnpm workspaces + Turborepo** · TypeScript strict / NodeNext · `tsup` for ESM+CJS+`.d.ts` · `zod` for runtime validation of AEM payloads · `@portabletext/block-tools` + `jsdom` for HTML → Portable Text · `@sanity/client` for ingest · `changesets` for releases.

---

## Status & contributing

The three runtime packages and the Studio app are production-shaped — `tenants/davids-bridal/` and `tenants/t-mobile/` are the integration suites. CI publish via Changesets is wired but not yet automated. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for contribution conventions (doc-refresh rules, commit discipline, regeneration recipes).

```bash
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r test
```

are the gates every change goes through.
